# Remote-Collaboration-Tool
This project focuses on improving real-time audio and video communication by addressing common connectivity, compatibility, and security challenges found in existing platforms. By leveraging WebRTC, the system delivers secure, high-quality, and low-latency communication across different browsers and operating systems.

🚀 Features
✅ Enhanced Connectivity

Resolves frequent audio/video disruptions found in traditional communication tools.

Ensures stable streaming even under fluctuating network conditions.

🌐 Cross-Platform Compatibility

Works seamlessly across major browsers and operating systems.

Eliminates common compatibility issues faced during media streaming.

🔒 Improved Security

Uses Secure RTP (SRTP) for encrypted audio & video transmission.

Incorporates WebRTC’s advanced security protocols for safe communication.

🎵 High-Fidelity Audio

Utilizes the Opus audio codec, known for delivering clear and adaptive voice quality.

🧩 Protocol-Driven Enhancement

Demonstrates how WebRTC’s built-in protocols significantly uplift connectivity, media quality, and security.
